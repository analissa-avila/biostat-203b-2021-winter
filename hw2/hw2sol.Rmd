## Q2. `read.csv` (base R) vs `read_csv` (tidyverse) vs `fread` (data.table)

There are quite a few utilities in R for reading data files. Let us test the speed of reading a moderate sized compressed csv file, `admissions.csv.gz`, by three programs: `read.csv` in base R, `read_csv` in tidyverse, and `fread` in the popular data.table package. Is there any speed difference?

In this homework, we stick to the tidyverse. 

#### Solution:
Reading `admissions.csv.gz` using `read.csv`
```{r}
system.time(read.csv(str_c(mimic_p, "/core/admissions.csv.gz")))
```

Reading `admissions.csv.gz` using `read_csv`
```{r}
system.time(read_csv(str_c(mimic_p, "/core/admissions.csv.gz")))
```

Reading `admissions.csv.gz` using `fread`
```{r}
system.time(fread(str_c(mimic_p, "/core/admissions.csv.gz")))
```
The `read_csv` function is about 10 times faster than the `read.csv` function. The `fread` function is the fastest, being about twice as fast as the `read_csv` function.


## Q3. ICU stays

`icustays.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/icu/icustays/>) contains data about Intensive Care Units (ICU) stays. Summarize following variables using appropriate numerics or graphs:   

- how many unique `stay_id`?  
- how many unique `subject_id`?  
- length of ICU stay  
- first ICU unit  
- last ICU unit  

#### Solution:

Read in icustays
```{r}
icustays_tab <- read_csv(str_c(mimic_p, "/icu/icustays.csv.gz")) %>%
  print(width = Inf)

```

*How many unique `stay_id`*
```{r}
icustays_tab %>%
  distinct(stay_id) %>%
  summarise(n_unique_stay_id = n())
```

*How many unique `subject_id`:* a patient can have more than one ICU stay
```{r}
icustays_tab %>%
  distinct(subject_id) %>%
  summarise(n_unique_subject_id = n())
```

*Distribution of length of ICU stay:* histogram and summary statistics  
The lenght of ICU stay ranges from 0.03 to 599.25 days. The median length of stay is 2.06 days with 75% of stays lasting 4.2 days or less.
```{r}
ggplot(data = icustays_tab) + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = los), bins=200) +
  xlab("Length of stay (days)") +
  ylab("Count")

options(pillar.sigfig = 5) #set number of significant figures to include when knit tibble

icustays_tab %>% 
  summarise(min = round(min(los), 2),
            mean = round(mean(los), 2),
            sd = round(sd(los), 2),
            Q1 = round(quantile(los, .25), 2),
            median = round(median(los), 2),
            Q3 = round(quantile(los, .75), 2),
            max = round(max(los), 2))


```

*Distribution of first ICU unit:* bar graph and frequency table  
The medical intensive care unit is the most common first ICU unit
```{r, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = icustays_tab) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(y = first_careunit)) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of First ICU Unit") +
  ylab("First ICU Unit") +
  xlab("Count")


options(pillar.sigfig = 5) #set number of significant figures to include when knit tibble

icustays_tab %>%
  group_by(first_careunit) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent = round(count/sum(count)*100, 2))
```

*Distribution of last ICU unit:* bar graph and frequency table  
The medical intensive care unit is the most common last ICU unit
```{r, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = icustays_tab) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(y = last_careunit)) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Last ICU Unit") +
  ylab("Last ICU Unit") +
  xlab("Count")


options(pillar.sigfig = 5) #set number of significant figures to include when knit tibble

icustays_tab %>%
  group_by(last_careunit) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent = round(count/sum(count)*100, 2))
```



## Q4. `admission` data

Information of the patients admitted into hospital is available in `ADMISSION.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/core/admissions/> for details of each field in this file. Summarize following variables using appropriate graphs. Explain any patterns you observe.   

- admission year  
- admission month  
- admission month day  
- admission week day  
- admission hour (anything unusual?)  
- number of deaths in each year  
- admission type  
- number of admissions per patient  
- admission location  
- discharge location  
- insurance  
- language  
- martial status  
- ethnicity  
- death 

Note it is possible that one patient (uniquely identified by the `SUBJECT_ID`) is admitted into hospital multiple times. When summarizing some demographic information, it makes sense to summarize based on unique patients. 


#### Solution:

Read in admissions
```{r}
admissions_tab <- read_csv(str_c(mimic_p, "/core/admissions.csv.gz")) %>%
  print(width = Inf)

```
*Summarizing admission year*  
From about the years 2130 to 2190, the number of admissions are fairly constant. There were less admission both before and after these years.
```{r}
admissions_tab %>% 
  count(admityear = year(admittime)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = admityear, y = n)) + 
  geom_line() +
  xlab("admission year") +
  ylab("count") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2110, 2210, 20))
```

*Summarizing admission month*  
Admissions are fairly evenly distributed across all months. February has the least number of admissions, which may be due to it being the shortest month.
```{r}
admissions_tab %>% 
  mutate(admitmonth = month(admittime, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = admitmonth)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  xlab("admission month") +
  ylab("count") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```

*Summarizing admission month day*  
Admissions are fairly evenly distributed across the first 28 days of the any month. The 29th, 30th, and 31st of any month have less admissions. This is possibly explained by the fact that not every month has those days.
```{r}
admissions_tab %>% 
  count(admitmonth_day = mday(admittime)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = admitmonth_day, y = n)) + 
  geom_line() +
  xlab("admission month day") +
  ylab("count") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 30, 5))
```

*Summarizing admission week day*  
Admissions are fairly evenly distributed across all week days. It seems that their are slightly more admissions on Saturdays.
```{r}
admissions_tab %>% 
  mutate(admitweek_day = wday(admittime, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = admitweek_day)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  xlab("admission week day") +
  ylab("count") 
```

*Summarizing admission hour*  
Admissions are most frequent around midnight with a steady decline until about 6:00am. The admission then increase from 6:00-7:00am before decreasing again until about 9:00am. From 9:00am to about 6:00pm admissions are steadily increasing. They then began to decrease again from 6:00pm to 11:00pm.
```{r}
admissions_tab %>% 
  count(admithour = hour(admittime)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = admithour, y = n)) + 
  geom_line() +
  xlab("admission hour") +
  ylab("count") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 23, 4))
```

*Summarizing number of deaths in each year*  
The number of deaths each year mostly increases between 2105 to about 2130. The number of deaths then fluctuates between about 100 and 140 until around 2189 before decreasing again. 
```{r, message=FALSE}
admissions_tab %>%
  mutate(admityear = year(admittime)) %>%
  group_by(admityear) %>%
  summarise(n_deaths = sum(hospital_expire_flag)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = admityear, y = n_deaths)) +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("admission year") +
  ylab("number of deaths") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2110, 2210, 20)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 150, 20))
```
*Summarizing admission type*  
EW emergency is the most frequent admission type and ambulatory observation is the least frequent.
```{r}
admissions_tab %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = admission_type)) +
  geom_bar() +
  ylab("admission type")
```

*Summarizing number of admissions per patient*  
The number of admissions per patient ranges from 1 to 238. The median number of admissions per patient is 3, with 75% of patients having 7 or less admissions. 
```{r, message=FALSE}
admissions_tab %>%
  group_by(subject_id) %>%
  summarise(n_admissions = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = n_admissions)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 100) + 
  xlab("number of admissions per patient") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 250, 25))

admissions_tab %>%
  group_by(subject_id) %>%
  mutate(n_admissions = n()) %>%
  ungroup(subject_id) %>%
  summarise(min = round(min(n_admissions), 2),
            mean = round(mean(n_admissions), 2),
            sd = round(sd(n_admissions), 2),
            Q1 = round(quantile(n_admissions, .25), 2),
            median = round(median(n_admissions), 2),
            Q3 = round(quantile(n_admissions, .75), 2),
            max = round(max(n_admissions), 2))

```

*Summarizing admission location*  
The vast majority of admissions were via the emergency room. Admissions via physician referral is the next most common. 
```{r}
admissions_tab %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = admission_location)) +
  geom_bar() +
  ylab("admission location")
```

*Summarizing discharge location*  
The most frequent discharge location is home. The next most common discharge locations are not available, home health center, and skilled nursing facility.
```{r}
admissions_tab %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = discharge_location)) +
  geom_bar() +
  ylab("discharge location")
```

*Summarizing insurance*  
Since a patient can have more than one type of insurance across admissions, I did not summarize based on unique patients.  
Insurances other than mediacare and medicade are most frequently used. Medicare is more frequently used than medicaid.
```{r}
# check if patient can have more than one type of insurance
admissions_tab %>%
  group_by(subject_id) %>%
  mutate(n_insurance_pt = n_distinct(insurance)) %>%
  ungroup(subject_id) %>%
  summarise(min = min(n_insurance_pt),
            max = max(n_insurance_pt))

admissions_tab %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = insurance)) +
  geom_bar() +
  ylab("insurance") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma)
```

*Summarizing language*  
I summarized each patients reported language at their *first* admission. There are only two possible language values: English and ? (unknown). English is much more frequent than unknown.
```{r}
# subset data to only include first admission records for each patient
admissions_tab_first <- admissions_tab %>%
  group_by(subject_id) %>%
  slice(which.min(admittime))

admissions_tab_first %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = language)) +
  geom_bar()

```

*Summarizing marital status*  
I summarized each patients reported marital status at their *first* admission. Married is the most frequent status and divorced is the least frequent.
```{r}
admissions_tab_first %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = marital_status)) +
  geom_bar() +
  xlab("marital status")
```

*Summarizing ethnicity*  
I summarized each patients reported ethnicity at their *first* admission. White is by far the most frequent ethnicity and American Indian/Alaska Native is the least common.
```{r}
admissions_tab_first %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = ethnicity)) +
  geom_bar()
```

*Summarizing death*  
There are 7 patients with more than 1 death record (i.e. more than 1 hospitalization in which the patient was flagged as having died).  

```{r}
#number of patients with more than 1 death record
admissions_tab %>%
  group_by(subject_id) %>%
  mutate(death = sum(hospital_expire_flag)) %>%
  filter(death > 1) %>%
  distinct(subject_id) %>%
  ungroup(subject_id) %>%
  summarise(n_multiple_death_records = n())
  
View(admissions_tab %>%
  group_by(subject_id) %>%
  mutate(death = sum(hospital_expire_flag)) %>%
  filter(death > 0 & !is.na(deathtime)))
  #ungroup(subject_id) %>%
  #summarise(n_multiple_death_records = n())

  
```



## Q5. `patient` data

Explore `patients.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/core/patients/>) and summarize following variables using appropriate numerics and graphs:  

- `gender`  
- `anchor_age` (explain pattern you see)


#### Soultion: 

Read in patients
```{r}
patients_tab <- read_csv(str_c(mimic_p, "/core/patients.csv.gz")) %>%
  print(width = Inf)

```

## Q6. Lab results

`labevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/hosp/labevents/>) contains all laboratory measurements for patients. 

We are interested in the lab measurements of creatinine (50912), potassium (50971), sodium (50983), chloride (50902), bicarbonate (50882), hematocrit (51221), white blood cell count (51301), glucose (50931), magnesium (50960), calcium (50893), and lactate (50813). Find the `itemid`s of these lab measurements from `d_labitems.csv.gz` and retrieve a subset of `labevents.csv.gz` only containing these items.


#### Soultion: 

Read in lab events
```{r}
if(!file.exists("labevents_icustays.csv.gz")){
  system.time(labevents_tab <- 
                fread(str_c(mimic_p, "/hosp/labevents.csv.gz"),
                      select = c("subject_id", "hadm_id", "itemid", "charttime", "valuenum"), 
                      nThread = 4))
  labevents_tab %>%
    semi_join(icustays_tab, by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id")) %>%
    fwrite("labevents_icustays.csv.gz", nThread = 4)
}

system.time(labevents_tab <- fread("labevents_icustays.csv.gz"))
labevents_tab %>%
  as.tibble() %>%
  print(width = Inf)

```

Read in the lab item dictionary
```{r}
dlabitems_tab <- read_csv(str_c(mimic_p, "/hosp/d_items.csv.gz")) %>%
  print(width = Inf)
```

Subset to lab measurements of interest
 - rename itemid = lab_itemid
```{r}
itemid_list <- c(50912, 50971, 50983, 50902, 50882, 51221, 51301, 50931, 50960, 50893, 50813)


```


## Q7. Vitals from chartered events

We are interested in the vitals for ICU patients: heart rate, mean and systolic blood pressure (invasive and noninvasive measurements combined), body temperature, SpO2, and respiratory rate.

`chartevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/icu/chartevents/>) contains all the charted data available for a patient. During their ICU stay, the primary repository of a patient’s information is their electronic chart. The `ITEMID` variable indicates a single measurement type in the database. The `VALUE` variable is the value measured for `ITEMID`. 

`d_items.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/icu/d_items/>) is the dictionary for the `ITEMID` in `CHARTEVENTS.csv`. Find potential values of `ITEMID` that correspond to systolic blood pressure, i.e., `LABEL` contains the string `systolic`. 

## Q8. Putting things together

Let us create a tibble for all ICU stays, where rows are  

- first ICU stay of each unique patient  
- adults (age at admission > 18)  

and columns contains at least following variables  

- all variables in `icustays.csv.gz`  
- all variables in `admission.csv.gz`  
- first lab measurements during ICU stay  (for each lab meas.)
- first vitals measurement during ICU stay  (for each vitals meas.)
- an indicator variable whether the patient died within 30 days of hospital admission  


```{r}
icustays_tab_first <- icustays_tab %>% 
  #subset to first ICU stay of each unique patient
  group_by(subject_id) %>%
  slice_min(intime) %>%
  #merge with admissions and patients data
  left_join(admissions_tab, by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id")) %>%
  left_join(patients_tab, by = "subject_id") %>%
  #subset to adults (patients age >=18 at admission)
  mutate(age_at_adm = year(admittime) - anchor_year + anchor_age) %>%
  filter(age_at_adm >= 18) %>%
  print(width = Inf)
  
```
